## Description
This project is a robust backend built with NodeJs, ExpressJS and MongoDB, designed to handle a variety of operations for a social media-like platform. It includes user controllers that manage registration, login, logout, and other user-related functionalities. The video controller allows users to perform CRUD operations on videos. Similarly, users can create, read, update, and delete comments and community post. The like controller enables users to like videos, comments, and community, enhancing user interaction and engagement. Additionally, a dashboard controller provides an overview of user activities and interactions. This backend serves as a solid foundation for a future frontend, paving the way for a full-stack social media application.
